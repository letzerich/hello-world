hello world & team,

David, thank you for bringing Tyler & I into your academy... Love it so far... "Right up my alley". Tyler and I have known each other for 20 years and 2 months. 

Self intro: I like to jog in my local area(s), lift light-weights at home, and read... I have a wife and son. 

-- Andrew
